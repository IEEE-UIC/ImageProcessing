
Created the PixelStreamServer

-Request images every 4sec from the Camera.
-- Tested for 20min without any issues
-- Will try and lower the image updates from 4sec to 1sec (maybe less) 

-Each socket connection is terminated after an image has been downloaded. 
--This is because the GET request returns a 'connection closed' field.
--The VivoTech API explains how to create a persistant tunnel using UART commands which if implemented would increase the image throughput dramatically

-The next step is to remove the header from the buffer and write the remaining data into a file and see if it opens in a image viewer.
-- If so then we can take the JPEG and grab the RGB values and pump it into our edge detecting software.
